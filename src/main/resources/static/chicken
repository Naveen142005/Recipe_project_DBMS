Chicken Biryani
Chicken Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic Indian dish made with marinated chicken, basmati rice, and a blend of traditional spices. The chicken is typically marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices like turmeric, cumin, and garam masala, which infuse the meat with a rich taste. Layered with partially cooked basmati rice, caramelized onions, fresh mint, and cilantro, the dish is then slow-cooked to perfection. This process, known as "dum," allows the flavors to meld together, giving the biryani a distinctive aroma and taste. Served with cooling raita or spicy salan, Chicken Biryani is a comforting meal that's both hearty and delicious.

To make Chicken Biryani, start by marinating 500g of chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Let this marinate for at least 30 minutes to enhance the flavor. Meanwhile, rinse and soak 2 cups of basmati rice for 20 minutes, then boil it in salted water with a few cardamom pods and a bay leaf until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the rice and set it aside. In a large pot, heat ghee or oil and fry sliced onions until golden brown; set half aside for garnishing. Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until tender, then add chopped tomatoes, slit green chilies, and biryani masala, cooking until the oil separates from the mixture. Next, layer half the partially cooked rice over the chicken, then top it with fried onions, fresh mint, and cilantro. Add the remaining rice on top and garnish similarly. If desired, drizzle saffron-infused milk for added aroma and color. Finally, cover the pot with a tight lid and cook on low heat (dum style) to let the flavors blend thoroughly. Serve hot with raita or a side of your choice.
